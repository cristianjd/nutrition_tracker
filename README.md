# Nutrition Tracker

Nutrition Tracker is a web application that allows users to track and visualize your daily intake of protein, fat, and carbohydrate.
It allows users to choose how many calories and in what macronutrient ratio they wish to consume daily.
It requires users to log thier meals using [FatSecret](http://www.fatsecret.com/) either on the web or through its mobile app.

Uses:
- [FatSecret OmniAuth Gem](https://github.com/scrawlon/fatsecret-omniauth) for constructing API calls.
- [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) for javascript charts to visualize daily intake.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.

Deployed to Heroku at [nutritiontracker.herokuapp.com](http://nutritiontracker.herokuapp.com).
